# Python Course Series for Air Quality Data Analysis

## What is ASAQ?

The African Society for Air Quality (ASAQ) is an organization that 
aims to raise awareness of the effects of air quality deterioration 
on health and to encourage international collaboration. 
ASAQ's activities include: 

- __Communication__: Providing a forum for scholars to communicate across borders 
- __Resource exchange__: Facilitating the sharing of information and resources between scholars 
- __Research contacts__: Encouraging the development of research contacts and connections between scholars and institutions in Africa and elsewhere 
- __Publications__: Producing materials that aim to expand awareness 
- __Training__: Organizing seminars, workshops, training courses on how to collect data, analyze it and disseminate it.

### Course objectives

The main goal of this course series is to present Python tools that can be used for 
accessing, manipulating and visualizing air quality data.
The series has several components:

- Introduction to Python
    - Data types (integer, float, bool, string)
    - Conditional statments
    - Loops
    - Functions
    - Modules
    - Datetime module
    - I/O on text filesM
- Core tools for Data Science
    - NumPy
    - Matplotlib
    - Pandas
- Data Analysis
    - Reading, manipulating and visulaizing time series geolocated data with Pandas, GeoPandas and MovingPandas

#### Prerequisites
Participants are expected to:
- Have the ability to program in another language (C, C++, Fortran, Java, Matlab, IDL, etc.). 
- Be able manipulate a web browser, to open command prompt window or terminal window and edit text files. 
- Have a gmail account (needed to have access to Google Colaboratory). Everything will be taught through the Google cloud based Jupyter notebook.

**Optional**: Participants may choose to install on their local machines the Anaconda Python Distribution.  We recommend that they install the Anaconda Python distribution by following the instructions at: [Anaconda installation Guide](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install/)

#### Pointers on Jupyter Notebook
We recommend that participants get familiar with Jupyter notebook.
