## Python for Air Quality Data Analysis



**Prerequisites**: Ideally, ability to program in another language (C, C++, Fortran, Java, Matlab, IDL, etc.). Participants are also expected to be able manipulate a web browser, to open command prompt window or terminal window and edit text files. A gmail account is needed.

To take this course, you are expected to:

- Have a gmail account (needed to have access to Google Colaboratory). Everything will be taught through the Google cloud based Jupyter notebook.
- Install on your local machine the Anaconda Python Distribution. It is not required but it is highly recommended.
 We recommend that you install the Anaconda Python distribution by following the instructions at: [Anaconda installation Guide](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install/)
